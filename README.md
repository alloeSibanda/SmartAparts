# Low Cost Design Smart Home Project

This project aims to create a low-cost smart home system using Java, Raspberry Pi, MQTT, Raspberry Pi GPIO, and Raspberry Pi peripherals. The goal is to build a customizable and affordable solution for controlling and monitoring various aspects of a smart home.

## Project Components
The project includes the following components:

### Java Application 
A Java application running on a Raspberry Pi that acts as the central hub for controlling and managing the smart home devices. The application communicates with the smart home devices using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol.

### Raspberry Pi 
A Raspberry Pi is used as the hardware platform for running the Java application and interfacing with the smart home devices. It provides the processing power and connectivity required for the smart home system.

### MQTT 
MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol that facilitates communication between the Java application and the smart home devices. It enables efficient and reliable data exchange for controlling and monitoring the devices.

### Raspberry Pi GPIO
The Java application interacts with the Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins to control and read signals from external devices such as sensors, actuators, and peripherals.

### Raspberry Pi Peripherals
Various peripherals can be connected to the Raspberry Pi, such as sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion), actuators (e.g., lights, motors), and other devices to enhance the functionality of the smart home system.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Set up a Raspberry Pi by installing the operating system (e.g., Raspbian) and configuring the network connectivity.

Install Java on the Raspberry Pi. You can use OpenJDK or Oracle JDK depending on your preference.

Clone or download this project repository to your Raspberry Pi.

Connect the required peripherals to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins or USB ports, depending on the specific devices you intend to use.

Configure the MQTT broker details in the Java application. Update the connection parameters (e.g., broker address, port, credentials) in the code to match your MQTT broker setup.

Customize the Java application to include the specific logic and functionality you desire for your smart home system. This may include defining MQTT topics, subscribing to sensor data, publishing commands to control devices, and handling the communication with peripherals.

Compile and run the Java application on the Raspberry Pi. Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions to access the GPIO pins and interact with the peripherals.

Test and validate the smart home system by observing the communication between the Java application, MQTT broker, and the connected devices. Verify that commands are correctly received and executed, and sensor data is being published and monitored.
